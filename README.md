# Booklist is a culminating project created for Launchcode's Liftoff class to showcase skills learned.
Booklist addresses the needs of the avid reader who can't remember what they want to read, 
and how they reacted to the books they read. 
The program uses Java, Thymeleaf, CSS, HTML, an API.
It allows users to add book titles and authors to a list, view the entire list of books read and unread, 
and view by rating or unread lists.
